# Day-1
# Namaste React

Welcome to the world of React! In this README file, we will explore the basics of React and get you started on your journey to becoming a React developer.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to build complex UIs by composing smaller, reusable components.

## Getting Started

To start using React, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, please follow the official documentation to get them set up.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create a new React project using the `create-react-app` command. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-react-app` with a basic React project structure. Navigate into the project directory by running:

```
cd my-react-app
```

Now, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your React app in your default browser. You can now begin building your React application by editing the files in the `src` directory.

## Learning Resources

React has a vast ecosystem with plenty of learning resources available. Here are some recommended resources to help you get started:

- Official React Documentation: [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
